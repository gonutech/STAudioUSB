# Jan12 Initialize project
Hardware specification:
  
  
Software specification base on ST project sample
  - Input audio wave can be read from:
      + External USB key
      + Internal flash (*) TBD - do it later
    The external USB can be access through USB FS core (onchip hardware in Host mode)
    Audio format PCM (Pulse-code modulation / the method to digitally represent sample from analog signal / uncompressed wave data signal / .WAV file)

  - Processing signal:
      + The wave from USB is parsed to detect sample rate in order to configure the I2S.
      + The playback is managed with double buffering.
          First buffer is used to store the wave data retrived from USB key using FatFS
          Once first buffer is filled, DMA sends it content to I2S peripheral module.
          The data from USB key is stored in a second buffer.
          Then these two buffers are swapped indefinitely, till end of process.
